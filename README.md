Scripts and statistical analysis related to memory tournaments training
## Notes :  
- This is not intended to be a high quality repo (messy code, lack of documentation, bad file structure)
- Tested on python2.7 32bits windows.   
- spokenNumbers_audio.py won't work for a different OS than windows   
- Audio files are in french.    
- reactionTime_training.py implements a special mode for training reaction time (i.e remember the related image) : if the reaction time is above the desired goal, then the number is pushed back 4 to 7 spots later.   
- Feel free to adapt these scripts for your needs.   
- The statistical analysis is realised with R, a free and open source data analysis software. The HTML is built with knitr. You can check the html generated at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brumar/MnemoTrain/blob/master/Training_analysis/Perf_Numer_Analysis.html
